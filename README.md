#InSAR Scripts

I keep useful scripts for working with ROI_PAC here. Put them on your computer with:

```
git clone https://github.com/scottyhq/insar_scripts
```

## Notes
I have a [web page](http://scottyhq.github.io/blog) with more indepth notes for certain procedures. I don't forsee updating it regularly, but there currently instructions for [installing ROI_PAC on MacOSX](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/01/install-roipac-mac/) and [installing MDX software](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/03/install-mdx-mac/)... among a few other things.

I also recommend this excellent [online tutorial](http://faculty.washington.edu/dasc/WikiRoiPac/welcome) by Dave Schmidt. And the [short course materials](https://www.unavco.org/edu_outreach/short-courses/2011/insar/insar.html) on the UNAVCO website.

#InSAR Scripts

Useful scripts for working with ROI_PAC are kept here. Check out the various directories.

## Notes
I have a [web page](http://scottyhq.github.io/blog) with more indepth notes for certain procedures. I don't forsee updating it regularly, but there currently instructions for [installing ROI_PAC on MacOSX](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/01/install-roipac-mac/) and [installing MDX software](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/03/install-mdx-mac/)... among a few other things.

# InSAR Scripts

I keep useful scripts for working with ROI_PAC here. Put them on your computer with:

```
git clone https://github.com/scottyhq/insar_scripts
```

## Additional Information
I have a [web page](http://scottyhq.github.io/blog) with more indepth notes for certain procedures. I don't forsee updating it regularly, but there currently instructions for [installing ROI_PAC on MacOSX](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/01/install-roipac-mac/) and [installing MDX software](https://scottyhq.github.io/blog/2014/02/03/install-mdx-mac/)... among a few other things.

## Wikis, etc.
There are several user-contributed wiki pages that have lots of information on InSAR and ROI_PAC. 

* [WinSAR Wiki](https://winsar.unavco.org/portal/wiki/WikiIndex) probably is the most up-to-date, and includes the old ROI_PAC wiki website.

* [ROI_PAC Tutorial](http://faculty.washington.edu/dasc/WikiRoiPac/welcome) by Professor Dave Schmidt. 

* [UNAVCO Short Courses](https://www.unavco.org/education/advancing-geodetic-skills/short-courses/short-courses.html) are run every summer and have lots of useful content.
